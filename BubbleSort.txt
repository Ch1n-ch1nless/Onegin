[379] Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
[380] O Russia!
[381] In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
[382] Less influence on lady's head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,
[383] Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina' To put the ‘belle Tatiana'
[384] Oh, don't know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
[385] And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
[386] Eugene's letter to Tatyana
[387] At once was frightened my Tatyana...
[388] Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina
[389] ‘Pachette!'- Alina!
[390] It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
[391] Is whitening on Lukérya Lvovna, The same yet lies Lytibóv Petróvna.
[392] Well, many trifles like the bra.
[393] Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
[394] Etcetera.
[395] The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
[396] By hard from big Tambóv's engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva,
[397] ‘Ah, Tanya!
[398] ‘What big is Tanya!
[399] Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
[400] Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
[401] But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
[402] To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
[403] And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
[404] He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead,
[405] The shades of night are now rare And Vesper's met by cock ahead.
[406] My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?
[407] The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head
[408] One's horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
[409] But wretched is, who's all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
[410] To get him up she isn't asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
[411] In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
[412] He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
[413] First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
[414] And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
[415] She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
[416] A book at mornings here read...
[417] Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
[418] Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
[419] Let's read
[420] To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn't read,
[421] Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
[422] You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter's mirth you'd had.
[423] But none she had!
[424] Thank God, more clearly - she's feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
[425] Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
[426] He's puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky's head For sufferings, he here had.
[427] He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
[428] In Tanya's, Olga's rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
[429] Its time for dinner, Guests have had
[430] Let it be so: you have had
[431] Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss they've had;
[432] Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady's Fashion Journal had
[433] Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
[434] With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
[435] And she has had
[436] Of tyrant you didn't fear, But now he your fate has had.
[437] And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
[438] To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
[439] And old barin room this had;
[440] They'd better laugh before they had
[441] At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
[442] “Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he'd be glad”.
[443] It's nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
[444] His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
[445] But you are tortured by the road.
[446] That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
[447] Across a glade, all under snow Around which all's dark and sad.
[448] Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
[449] You tell, of them which is Tatyana?' -That girl, which's always so sad;
[450] In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
[451] And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
[452] She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
[453] That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
[454] Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
[455] Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
[456] Tell again, You see, I'm now muddle-headed.
[457] With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
[458] Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
[459] Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
[460] The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
[461] Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
[462] Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
[463] Not madrigals my Lensky's writing In Olga's album, and indeed
[464] I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
[465] Of elegy's bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
[466] Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya's dear heart indeed.
[467] Let's listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.
[468] Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
[469] The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
[470] But suddenly her sister's coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
[471] By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
[472] With you I now tears shed;
[473] My muse in ethics well embodied!
[474] At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
[475] It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
[476] Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
[477] The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
[478] Ah, many were by fate denied!
[479] In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
[480] In many trends he'd change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
[481] Of enemy from pistol parried.
[482] By many signs she's always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
[483] To have a talk with her he tried
[484] Such custom's known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
[485] Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
[486] May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.
[487] And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
[488] For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul's filled
[489] At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
[490] He's killed!..
[491] A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he's killed...'
[492] (Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
[493] To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
[494] All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
[495] The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
[496] ‘Ah, father my! the profit's worsened..'.
[497] She's wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she's often frightened,
[498] Of praised grandfather's old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
[499] In his first youth he was untrained,
[500] Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
[501] Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
[502] He's blessed, who with his love combined
[503] You see, by skies its predestined:
[504] ‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?' By you I'm often briskly questioned, -
[505] He's always frowned, taciturn, He's chilly, jealous, angry turned!
[506] At last it stopped.
[507] But Eugene's fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
[508] Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
[509] Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
[510] Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
[511] All's good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
[512] Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
[513] At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
[514] ‘What for you early disappeared?'
[515] It now; but ‘Bordeaux' prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
[516] And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
[517] But withered!
[518] By habits of the life he's pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
[519] But how greatly Tanya's altered!
[520] Or not for long her heart was shattered
[521] As if by greenish down covered.
[522] Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
[523] Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
[524] He was afraid of being answered
[525] Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he's admired;
[526] By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who's admired?
[527] They don't cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
[528] ‘And whom your lovely verse adored?'
[529] Are drying valleys many-coloured;
[530] The ashes patriarchal honoured.
[531] Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
[532] By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
[533] Without them Onegm's pictured.
[534] And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
[535] Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
[536] Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
[537] In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
[538] Some noise by beetle's raised.
[539] At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
[540] My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,
[541] Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
[542] He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
[543] All fashioned model of the creature Who's dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
[544] Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed».
[545] And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
[546] He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
[547] In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
[548] Buyánov courted: was refused.
[549] At first his language me confused,
[550] Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
[551] Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
[552] Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
[553] Malvina's works but separated For several roubles he abated,
[554] But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
[555] All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
[556] Or that's because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,
[557] Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
[558] They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
[559] But something more us separated...
[560] Appolo's children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
[561] At least he'd my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
[562] Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet's keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
[563] But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
[564] Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
[565] That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
[566] Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
[567] The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
[568] His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
[569] The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
[570] The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
[571] To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
[572] Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
[573] Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
[574] By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
[575] And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
[576] The shining skies are now blued.
[577] That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
[578] For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
[579] All that I gladlessly survived.
[580] But now doubts all are solved:
[581] You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
[582] Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.
[583] Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
[584] Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
[585] By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
[586] My father gave consent to wed.
[587] His life's monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
[588] Decayed...
[589] Her role how firmly played,
[590] Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
[591] To meet the scholar world's desire I could describe, you'd be amazed.
[592] Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
[593] His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
[594] His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
[595] Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
[596] On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
[597] Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
[598] To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
[599] But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
[600] Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
[601] In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
[602] ‘Well, he is killed',- the neighbour said.
[603] I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
[604] Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
[605] But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
[606] Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
[607] Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
[608] And what for is can now lurid?
[609] To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
[610] Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
[611] My poor Tanya sits, can't sleep, And looks into the darkling field.
[612] Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
[613] As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
[614] He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
[615] Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
[616] ‘You see, Tatyana's not a child,' The old woman's voice is mild,-
[617] And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
[618] Sad and cold,
[619] What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
[620] He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
[621] The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
[622] ‘Vladimir Lensky here's lain, He met his death like man quite hold
[623] Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
[624] Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
[625] And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
[626] Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
[627] Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?
[628] Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
[629] Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he'd my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world…
[630] And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
[631] For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That's all he knew in own world...)
[632] At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
[633] With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
[634] At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
[635] By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
[636] More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand
[637] Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
[638] To come to tables hand in hand.
[639] You'll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
[640] Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
[641] The tea's been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
[642] She's troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe's hand
[643] In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
[644] His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
[645] Hurra! we all have reached the land.
[646] His father didn't understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
[647] They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
[648] And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
[649] ‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?' -All right, my dear, you command.-
[650] Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;
[651] Meanwhile his eyes off her can't tear Some general important, grand.
[652] The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
[653] That uhlan's loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand
[654] Not grasping ways to understand
[655] Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
[656] Indeed, for long should have the end!
[657] I know, you were sent by goodness, You'll be my guard until the end,
[658] He's blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
[659] What's the end?
[660] She's trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn't hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
[661] And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
[662] The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I'm staunch a friend.
[663] With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same's monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
[664] With might and main he'll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
[665] Is not it so, friend?
[666] My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
[667] But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
[668] They've made me marry other man; And I'll be true to him till end!
[669] To me true compass now lend
[670] At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
[671] From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
[672] To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
[673] To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
[674] I'll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
[675] I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
[676] Such subject's worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
[677] The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
[678] Or dismal eye will never find
[679] Could my Onegin now find.
[680] Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
[681] To hostess a lady's heading, Some plump grand general's behind.
[682] You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
[683] But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
[684] The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
[685] And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
[686] His soul's warmed with inspiration By lady's greetings, friendly kind.
[687] In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
[688] Forgotten features can remind.
[689] She's writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene's kept in mind,
[690] My poor mind...
[691] ‘You tell me, prince, if don't mind,
[692] Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
[693] On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
[694] Is really the secret's found?
[695] The girls are jumping all around.
[696] She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
[697] On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
[698] The hall is full of crowd; The music's weary of sound;
[699] ‘But how did you marry, nanny?' -It was by wish of God.
[700] Last evening frightful words I'd heard; Thank God!
[701] By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
[702] With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
[703] In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
[704] The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
[705] She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
[706] He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
[707] Of Moscow young graces good
[708] In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
[709] At the games of maidenhood.
[710] And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
[711] In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
[712] Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
[713] But now - God! - is cooling blood
[714] In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
[715] By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
[716] Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
[717] But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
[718] Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,
[719] Each topic's argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
[720] For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
[721] Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
[722] Yet limpid is the near wood
[723] He isn't more… The youngling bard
[724] My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.
[725] Forgive me, isn't it too hard?' -For me it's not - ‘But dear bard,
[726] It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
[727] Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
[728] Bewildered and astonished hard...
[729] Of years young but whithered hard,
[730] Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
[731] The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
[732] She looks, and all her own heart More often's heating and more hard.
[733] The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
[734] To loose his colour he's beginning: She doesn't see or she's too hard!?
[735] But they would madden it too hard.
[736] The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
[737] Has found end untimely hard!
[738] For evening whist who's coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
[739] And exclamations at the board:
[740] On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He's taking home dreadful hoard,
[741] They say, they'd got For that the best in world reward.
[742] 'Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
[743] Report for him was so sudden From steward:
[744] She enters a deserted yard.
[745] The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
[746] That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
[747] My dear early little bird!
[748] He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
[749] ‘Ah, my Lord!',
[750] For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
[751] Of course, he thinks, ‘I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
[752] And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
[753] The enmity's afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
[754] And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
[755] With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
[756] Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
[757] By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
[758] The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
[759] With goat's beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
[760] Around Tanya ladies crowd,
[761] To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
[762] She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
[763] With time I'd smooth and then might be I'd find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
[764] His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
[765] But I… it doesn't bother me: To old times I'll loyal be.
[766] It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
[767] Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be...
[768] For long has chance with us to be?
[769] If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
[770] Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn't be.
[771] But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won't be
[772] From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
[773] Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow's languid peace.
[774] Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
[775] Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She'd catch one's eyes by simple face.
[776] With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
[777] They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
[778] Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
[779] Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
[780] And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
[781] In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
[782] All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
[783] They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
[784] In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
[785] But then a frenchman took her place.
[786] What foolish, dumpy is this place!
[787] At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
[788] Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
[789] Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It's poet of grace!'
[790] The boy was frisky but with grace.
[791] But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
[792] But well, she's named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister's pretty grace,
[793] Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
[794] At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
[795] It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
[796] Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
[797] And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden's choice,
[798] Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
[799] And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
[800] Tatyana's flushing, all she's trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
[801] Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
[802] What joy: to-day we'll have to dance!
[803] With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
[804] Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
[805] The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
[806] The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
[807] The colonel sent it for the chance.
[808] Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady's album if by chance,
[809] He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
[810] For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
[811] But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
[812] But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
[813] Tatyana's pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
[814] But like a house all deserted It's dark and still, and not by chance
[815] The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn't smoothed by any chance:
[816] Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
[817] Meanwhile her soul's feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...
[818] My Lensky's feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
[819] Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden's names by names from France,
[820] None soul's seen in rooms at entrance...
[821] She's mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
[822] The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
[823] The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
[824] Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
[825] Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
[826] They rush into the yard at once!
[827] But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
[828] He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
[829] But soon for husband, all at once,
[830] It's mute for ever all at once.
[831] Was asking Olya him at once
[832] Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
[833] The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet's fat at once,
[834] To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he's a dunce.
[835] But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
[836] You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
[837] Away from Eugene's lips; morose, He's awkward, hardly has he force
[838] Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;
[839] The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
[840] He looks al her with tender ardour; He's yet beloved with previous force,
[841] And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
[842] Boom could fade.
[843] But his such sufferable shade,
[844] In winter, when the night's weak shade
[845] Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
[846] All's blight, all's white without shade.
[847] Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
[848] He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
[849] Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
[850] Perhaps, in Lethe won't perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;
[851] I can't foresee any objection To this representation made.
[852] And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
[853] By winter carpets, snow-made.
[854] All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
[855] In man's attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
[856] Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
[857] Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
[858] He's handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
[859] For husband then she was yet bride.
[860] Some real honour and the pride.
[861] Was talking much of them with pride.
[862] With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
[863] ‘...can't sleep, it's stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...'
[864] A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
[865] The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
[866] Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
[867] The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
[868] Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
[869] ‘You tell of those Your old times... I've boring tide..'
[870] Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
[871] Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;
[872] God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
[873] Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
[874] He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
[875] And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she's free.
[876] In tender manner they agree.
[877] To fix her fate it's time, I see;
[878] It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
[879] They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
[880] The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
[881] The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
[882] And by the people's usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
[883] ‘D'you think.' indeed... suspicions any… But do you see...
[884] Diana's breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
[885] ‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
[886] My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!
[887] But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
[888] And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
[889] Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
[890] ‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
[891] As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
[892] By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
[893] Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I've ruined much of own life.
[894] Who's waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
[895] Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
[896] And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
[897] ‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
[898] It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
[899] With war; with magazine's white lie; With snow and with own wife,
[900] Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
[901] Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
[902] With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
[903] ‘But who is she?' She is my wife,
[904] Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
[905] They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
[906] At boring aunt's my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
[907] With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,
[908] For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
[909] You lie, young hard, in peace all age!'
[910] Such time what can you do in village?
[911] With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
[912] Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
[913] At such a year, such an age.
[914] It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
[915] A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
[916] Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
[917] Of young delirium high rage.
[918] As legends say of old age (For that we'd praise in him the sage).
[919] And great belief in world's perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
[920] Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
[921] With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
[922] All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
[923] I don't grudge: why should I grudge?
[924] - Princess, mon ange! -
[925] To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
[926] He can't give happiness at large'.
[927] And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
[928] In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
[929] My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.
[930] Yes, It is he...
[931] Who's he?
[932] And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn't move and doesn't breathe;
[933] But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
[934] He couldn't be a bard for ever, He didn't go mad or die,
[935] In brackets I would like to note: You haven't more insulting lie,
[936] The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
[937] As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
[938] Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
[939] All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
[940] To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you'd like, Or Eden to itself's unlike.
[941] - D'you joke -
[942] I'm hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
[943] The field is dark in pretty gale...
[944] Before arrival; anyhow She isn't bothered (that's female!);
[945] Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
[946] The autumn golden is coming, The nature's now trembling, pale
[947] Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
[948] It is forgivable.
[949] And give you all that 1 could scribble
[950] ‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
[951] Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?'
[952] Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
[953] Impossible!?
[954] Arid, following Petrarka's tracks, Could calm his heart's the biggest trouble.
[955] By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
[956] And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
[957] To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
[958] Perhaps I'll grieve if in a while
[959] Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
[960] The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
[961] Of love mad sufferings she's feeling . Without ceasing for a while
[962] To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
[963] But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky's silent for a while
[964] They argue louder; he's getting Some long a knife; in short a while
[965] Meanwhile
[966] Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn't tell meanwhile.
[967] At Simeon's he's now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
[968] Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
[969] We must meanwhile
[970] To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
[971] His epigram's unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
[972] I don't like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
[973] Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
[974] La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui i'morir non dole.
[975] Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
[976] At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
[977] Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
[978] I don't mean to please grand people.
[979] Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
[980] With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
[981] They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
[982] Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
[983] Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
[984] While he prefered to play a steed. His finger's frozen a little,
[985] On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
[986] We knew the game of passion's oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
[987] In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
[988] I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
[989] It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
[990] The love's foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
[991] Such men (I'm first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
[992] They friends became.
[993] Child-Harold's copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
[994] Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
[995] But Tanya's heart yet isn't gladdened, To meet the winter never came,

[997] In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
[998] I'm free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
[999] They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
[1000] Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
[1001] By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
[1002] Enough, my friend, its all the same!
[1003] Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it's all the same.
[1004] To him she doesn't pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
[1005] ‘Well, no, just the same...
[1006] Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
[1007] But road alarm of love then filled me.
[1008] Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
[1009] Forgive me'.
[1010] With my request immodest, gladless I'd trouble you for helping me:
[1011] To play the cards was used with me.
[1012] ‘But now tell;' she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?'
[1013] The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
[1014] My friends, on bard you'd have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime
[1015] ‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
[1016] I ask: be patient for a time;
[1017] Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
[1018] All services of old time.
[1019] And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
[1020] Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
[1021] Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
[1022] ‘Who might be thinking... all the time!
[1023] From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
[1024] Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,

[1029] And passed away of tears time?
[1030] To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
[1031] For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn't time
[1032] Of course, of him I'll quickly know,- For him I now haven't time.
[1033] You must remember that day time,
[1034] Is drawn, in turn I've bad nay time.
[1035] For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
[1036] Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
[1037] When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
[1038] It was well known friendly wellcome:

[1042] His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
[1043] But are you listening yet to me?
[1044] It's true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
[1045] ‘Well... I, my nanny… don't know... For love I'm longing, dear me!
[1046] O'key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!
[1047] She's after me.
[1048] A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
[1049] By nothing bound, I'm a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
[1050] And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
[1051] Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
[1052] But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
[1053] Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).
[1054] Goodness me!

[1058] To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
[1059] It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
[1060] Ideal image, Tanya's rhyme...
[1061] By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
[1062] In brackets to the point I'd note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
[1063] Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
[1064] She sees: the room is light again, Through window's a frosty pane
[1065] My dashing Eugene?
[1066] ‘Here's He! that's Eugene!
[1067] At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
[1068] That time, when in lyceum's gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
[1069] Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
[1070] Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
[1071] To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
[1072] I could define
[1073] And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.
[1074] She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
[1075] The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
[1076] But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
[1077] With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
[1078] ‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
[1079] The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
[1080] A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
[1081] A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
[1082] Yet outside, as well's inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
[1083] Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
[1084] He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
[1085] My memory is dark.., I'm granny... And much forgot... of life the line
[1086] They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
[1087] Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
[1088] Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
[1089] And where is her sister line?
[1090] At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
[1091] And what can give me fate of mine?'
[1092] I write it, as for long my time I haven't any sin of mine.
[1093] I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
[1094] What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
[1095] To me that time you were quite right,' To you is grateful soul mine...
[1096] To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
[1097] All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It's mine! Its mine'
[1098] Alas, it's easy to divine!
[1099] 'He's ignoramus', said the neighbours, 'He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
[1100] And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
[1101] Of ‘Clicquot widow' or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
[1102] At Verrey's every morning's time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
[1103] The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
[1104] Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
[1105] I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
[1106] The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
[1107] Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
[1108] Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
[1109] She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
[1110] Pm sure... none, They'll be the family, the one.
[1111] To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
[1112] Well, I remember... has he gone?
[1113] You poets, are queer!' -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
[1114] At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
[1115] While at the moon Tatyana's looking, By own heart away she's gone...
[1116] When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
[1117] Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar's gone.
[1118] Unlucky victim, Lensky's gone...
[1119] ‘I don't hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
[1120] Have less in difference between Each one.
[1121] But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
[1122] In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid's temple, graves alone:
[1123] Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
[1124] But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
[1125] ‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
[1126] With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
[1127] Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
[1128] -But no one...
[1129] Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
[1130] From novel's only beginning — I've finished now chapter one.
[1131] Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
[1132] Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one
[1133] And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that's why at borne
[1134] Replace the fortune.
[1135] Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.
[1136] ‘I'll perish, - says my Tanya's voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
[1137] More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwat's octaves tune!
[1138] But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
[1139] He's blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He's blessed, who well in time was ripe.
[1140] By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
[1141] Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you'll give a hope;
[1142] His Olga's jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
[1143] You'll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
[1144] The foes put the capes on steppe.
[1145] And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
[1146] Ah, don't mind' -My friend, by God to hail I dare —
[1147] One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
[1148] To keep the happy stirrup dare...
[1149] Can't now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
[1150] What does next day for me prepare?
[1151] ‘I see, in world you've been too rare...
[1152] To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
[1153] In vain I try to be aware,
[1154] You didn't like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
[1155] My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
[1156] (Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can't adhere
[1157] The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
[1158] Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!' - l could here
[1159] He thinks of here:
[1160] On leave the gussars hasten here
[1161] And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
[1162] Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla's crowned there.
[1163] And there… -
[1164] Like women, books were all left here,
[1165] He isn't here...
[1166] The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
[1167] My goddesses' what are you? where?
[1168] The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
[1169] To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
[1170] To judgings by the world severe
[1171] To ride a horse in steppe severe?
[1172] I'd like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
[1173] Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
[1174] But what severe!
[1175] The fisher's fire.
[1176] Yet being child, in children's throng To play and jump had none desire,
[1177] But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
[1178] His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
[1179] They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
[1180] Italian nights I shall adore.
[1181] And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
[1182] To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
[1183] Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
[1184] Yes, I shall come, I'll come!' - before
[1185] The shepherd's singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
[1186] Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
[1187] Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).
[1188] Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
[1189] Much more... -
[1190] And in the solitude severe Her passion's heating yet much more,
[1191] Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
[1192] Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
[1193] Iván Petróvich's fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;
[1194] She's running - he is after her; She can't be running any more,
[1195] The tears of the people's awe. Katenin there could restore
[1196] Malfilatre.
[1197] The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
[1198] Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can't endure,
[1199] Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they'll not endure
[1200] Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
[1201] You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
[1202] It's right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
[1203] They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
[1204] And she, that young and lovely creature;
[1205] Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
[1206] Expresses death but not the torture.
[1207] The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
[1208] To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!'
[1209] He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
[1210] Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
[1211] With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
[1212] A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
[1213] Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
[1214] In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
[1215] Mazurka is the crowd's choice; All round are crush and noise;
[1216] He's languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
[1217] Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
[1218] His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
[1219] Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
[1220] Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
[1221] The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
[1222] Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
[1223] What purpose?
[1224] In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
[1225] My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose
[1226] The morning pleasant noise arose.
[1227] But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
[1228] I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d'you think? again collapse!'
[1229] The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
[1230] But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
[1231] He'll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
[1232] For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
[1233] He can't endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
[1234] In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
[1235] I live and write not for applause,
[1236] But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty's letter I should use.
[1237] With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
[1238] To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse
[1239] For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
[1240] Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
[1241] He doesn't gather them with horn. A maiden's singing in her house,
[1242] He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
[1243] There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
[1244] What's use?
[1245] Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
[1246] And with Onegin's recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
[1247] And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
[1248] Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
[1249] In life with us like new it's hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
[1250] Indeed, d'you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
[1251] Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
[1252] The heart of somebody he'll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
[1253] The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
[1254] Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
[1255] All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
[1256] I can't I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
[1257] But my fate
[1258] They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
[1259] At Kharitónya's in the alley In front of house at the gate
[1260] I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
[1261] I have without any doubts Tatyana's letter to translate.
[1262] It's late.
[1263] Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
[1264] ‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
[1265] As pawn that's worth of dear mate.
[1266] But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
[1267] Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
[1268] With love friends' notions I'd rate
[1269] Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
[1270] And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul's rate
[1271] Upstairs to the highest rate.
[1272] I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
[1273] And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
[1274] Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
[1275] He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
[1276] But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
[1277] The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
[1278] The capital's high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
[1279] By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
[1280] Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
[1281] To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I'd like to write,
[1282] His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
[1283] Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
[1284] About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
[1285] Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
[1286] Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
[1287] All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
[1288] Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
[1289] While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
[1290] And unattentive smart lornette.
[1291] Alas, Tatyana's daily fading: She's paling, sinking and is mute,
[1292] Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
[1293] She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
[1294] Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
[1295] Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter's trembling on her palm, The wafer's drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
[1296] The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven's blue
[1297] And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
[1298] But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
[1299] By new one can't I be admired I pity old one - it's true.
[1300] ‘Indeed? - my Eugene's now thinking, - But is it true?..
[1301] And that... but afterwards you'll know, Is not it true?
[1302] From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
[1303] On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
[1304] Marmontel's volume them he gave.
[1305] To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
[1306] And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
[1307] To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
[1308] At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You'd guess, as I would well behave
[1309] But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
[1310] Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
[1311] But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
[1312] And much the more it's nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
[1313] My dear God, you bless and save!
[1314] But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
[1315] He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
[1316] He's hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
[1317] What for to grieve?
[1318] You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
[1319] And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
[1320] A mere hit from all I'd give.
[1321] You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
[1322] Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can't some good translation give).
[1323] Forgive!
[1324] Arid thus we now part, forgive!
[1325] My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!
[1326] The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
[1327] And wondered: would he be alive?'
[1328] Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
[1329] To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
[1330] Which's shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
[1331] For what and where do I strive?
[1332] Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
[1333] In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
[1334] But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
[1335] Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
[1336] You help my doubts to resolve:
[1337] But can't you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
[1338] With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
[1339] On earth, then might be by her love She'd joined the friends the day above!
[1340] -Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
[1341] Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
[1342] Ah, he could love; they don't now Have anything like real love
[1343] Of poet, who's anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
[1344] And I'll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
[1345] About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
[1346] Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
[1347] But whom to love?
[1348] Or otherwise I'd be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-
[1349] If you could know, what's diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
[1350] Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;
[1351] Of humble girl some secret love?
[1352] The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
[1353] My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, I'm husband yours by love!"
[1354] By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
[1355] His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
[1356] I dread: in my submissive prayers You'll see by strict, severe gaze
[1357] Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one's gaze,
[1358] The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
[1359] His misty, foggy gaze
[1360] From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
[1361] His ardent talk was full of haze;
[1362] Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
[1363] He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
[1364] Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
[1365] Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul's haze.
[1366] Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship's heavy haze?
[1367] Like Harold Child Onegin's fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
[1368] And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
[1369] He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
[1370] Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
[1371] And nothing cooled his strong belief:
[1372] To comfort sorrow and grief.
[1373] And you, ‘Bordeaux' you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
[1374] The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
[1375] For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
[1376] And quickly both they yet off
[1377] At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
[1378] And then he dressed himself...
[1379] Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
[1380] Whose author bolter nature's feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
[1381] Onegin's out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
[1382] By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
[1383] Alone with his soul's self Unsatisfied was by himself.
[1384] To write about otherself As if about ownself?
[1385] Who's always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
[1386] But he's forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
[1387] Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
[1388] Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
[1389] Let's visit them; you'll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:
[1390] Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
[1391] To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
[1392] And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
[1393] Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
[1394] My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of
[1395] Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden's album big,
[1396] ‘But who? plump general that big?'
[1397] Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
[1398] Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
[1399] Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
[1400] It's both harmful and absorbing.
[1401] Sincerely, in grief embracing
[1402] And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he's dancing.
[1403] A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
[1404] Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
[1405] But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
[1406] All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life's novel reading,
[1407] At first of them she didn't think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
[1408] With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
[1409] The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
[1410] Alone's sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
[1411] The fire-place is fading...
[1412] Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
[1413] In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn't fading,
[1414] Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
[1415] Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
[1416] At fire-place the table's lain: Onegin's waiting - Lensky's speeding
[1417] Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
[1418] In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
[1419] Imagine: I'm alone, thus From no man have understanding...
[1420] To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
[1421] He trembles... to princess he's coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
[1422] He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
[1423] And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
[1424] You came two times, but then of self You don't make them yet reminding
[1425] Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding
[1426] Mazurka's sounding.
[1427] He didn't want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
[1428] Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
[1429] Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you'd be seeing
[1430] If she's seeing
[1431] With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn't seeing;
[1432] In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
[1433] What roses, you can be judging,
[1434] The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
[1435] Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I'm now singing,
[1436] Just He! His gaze on her he's fixing, Like dreadful shade for her he's reaching,
[1437] This way my Eugene was her teaching.
[1438] Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
[1439] To protests of soul's voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
[1440] The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
[1441] Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
[1442] As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
[1443] Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
[1444] Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
[1445] He looks, he calls him - all's for nothing!
[1446] I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
[1447] At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
[1448] Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
[1449] In horror Tanya is awaking...
[1450] A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
[1451] With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe's, Shiner's places hiking,
[1452] The clock's been striking
[1453] With dangerous book alone's hiking, In it reveals she so striking
[1454] Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
[1455] Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
[1456] And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
[1457] That was the way of Eugene's thinking.
[1458] In fear shameful heart is sinking.
[1459] And who, d'you think, from it is looking?
[1460] The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she's now looking:
[1461] But then with books she could be dealing.
[1462] ‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I'm never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin' -Well done dealing.
[1463] To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
[1464] When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare's trembling
[1465] Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
[1466] Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world's fuss she's hatred feeling.
[1467] Tatyana's now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
[1468] A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
[1469] Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
[1470] Onegin's pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
[1471] Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
[1472] Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
[1473] - All they are yet feeling
[1474] Onegin's soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
[1475] For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
[1476] (Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
[1477] Surprises deeply all his reeling?
[1478] I've been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I'm dangling:
[1479] All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
[1480] To Lensky he could listen smiling.
[1481] At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table's falling
[1482] In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
[1483] At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
[1484] Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
[1485] In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
[1486] In fear I was crying, darling,
[1487] Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
[1488] With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
[1489] Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter's bed till day was dreaming
[1490] About what she's now dreaming?
[1491] That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
[1492] Too long the silence's now seeming...
[1493] For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
[1494] The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
[1495] They laugh; the guests are now coming.
[1496] What languid is her gaze guile charming:
[1497] The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
[1498] Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
[1499] Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
[1500] To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty's passion mood, resuming
[1501] Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
[1502] His nets for them were so frightening!
[1503] Or where Thalia's stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isn't listening;
[1504] That recently I was you christening?'
[1505] You don't want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
[1506] The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
[1507] With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
[1508] He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
[1509] I love you (why should I be cunning?).
[1510] He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
[1511] All barking, dogs to her are running.
[1512] A brave sledge-cart from field's returning, It's fluffy furrows upturning,
[1513] Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning
[1514] A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
[1515] But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
[1516] And what's Onegin doing?
[1517] Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now's keeping.
[1518] D'you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?'
[1519] Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
[1520] Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he's sleeping,
[1521] Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
[1522] And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she's shyly stepping
[1523] To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn't grasping.
[1524] For fair of the brides her bring,
[1525] They say, you are a lone guy, In country's stillness you are boring.
[1526] I…' -But you are boring
[1527] Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
[1528] Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
[1529] And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
[1530] An Lane's home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
[1531] On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
[1532] Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
[1533] He hurries up to ring.
[1534] Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
[1535] For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
[1536] Let's turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...
[1537] And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
[1538] It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I can't be appraising,
[1539] And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
[1540] Nor makes get up without choosing.
[1541] To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
[1542] For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
[1543] In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
[1544] Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
[1545] Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it's quite distressing
[1546] Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
[1547] Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
[1548] For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
[1549] But Hymen's troubles, griefs of mating,
[1550] As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
[1551] Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
[1552] At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
[1553] Invitations for a meeting?
[1554] What was the sequence of the meeting?
[1555] In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
[1556] By clear smile the nature's fitting Through dream the year's morning meeting
[1557] She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
[1558] From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
[1559] To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
[1560] A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
[1561] He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
[1562] Ran up and not without fighting
[1563] To Talon's surely he's raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
[1564] For his delight were just awaiting.
[1565] At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
[1566] Already for triumph he's waiting,
[1567] Khandra pursued him, always waiting,
[1568] His scandal talks were such backbiting!
[1569] And by the salt of worlds backbiting
[1570] A passionate epistle's writing.
[1571] That's why in French she's always writing.
[1572] I prize my hours, my days: But I'm in idle boredom wasting
[1573] And then at prince she was adjusting
[1574] Whom you'd be trusting?
[1575] At last she's very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
[1576] I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
[1577] Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
[1578] At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
[1579] In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let's return to lady sitting.
[1580] And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
[1581] The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
[1582] Regards of them to you I'm giving.
[1583] But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
[1584] ‘And I was gingebread you giving!'
[1585] My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,
[1586] In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
[1587] That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
[1588] All yet living
[1589] And now North, all clouds driving,
[1590] By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
[1591] And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
[1592] The snow-drift at once is moving...
[1593] Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
[1594] At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain's moving
[1595] She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
[1596] I write, and heart yet isn't boring, The pen unwitting isn't drawing
[1597] Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
[1598] Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
[1599] Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
[1600] She all is trembling, paling, shying.
[1601] To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
[1602] But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
[1603] Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
[1604] ‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!'
[1605] To guess the windy youth is trying
[1606] A lady's love until to-day To speak her Russian isn't trying,
[1607] Maiden's Song
[1608] The evening darkness comes along...
[1609] Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
[1610] Of men, whom I can't judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
[1611] But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
[1612] The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
[1613] His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
[1614] The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
[1615] She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
[1616] For flying glory don't long.
[1617] For how long?
[1618] She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
[1619] The master's gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
[1620] Or really she guessed not wrong?
[1621] Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
[1622] Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young
[1623] What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
[1624] Each minute more is captivated By Olga's beauty so young,
[1625] And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
[1626] Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
[1627] I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
[1628] At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
[1629] And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
[1630] ‘Ah, Eugene!', - She is quickly running, Like shade she's prompt, to exit's jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it's hard; In short a minute she's been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
[1631] With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
[1632] Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
[1633] It's striking ten; he's driving out. He's flying... now he's at porch.
[1634] But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
[1635] At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
[1636] At neighbour's monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
[1637] In hands I have Tatyana's letter. It's kept by me with sacred sigh.
[1638] Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
[1639] To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
[1640] Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
[1641] Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
[1642] But Latin's not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
[1643] Could me enjoy... I've had my fill; It is enough!
[1644] Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
[1645] But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
[1646] The coachman's on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
[1647] If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
[1648] Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
[1649] And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
[1650] Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
[1651] In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
[1652] Who carefully us can cherish?
[1653] Who helps from slander not to perish?
[1654] Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
[1655] As object of the judging noisy, In life you'd never have a wish:
[1656] You'll see: they all become the bosh
[1657] Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
[1658] Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath
[1659] He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can't have breath..
[1660] He's trembling, loses fitting words, He's happy, has improved his health,
[1661] The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
[1662] The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
[1663] And so grew they old both.
[1664] My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,
[1665] Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
[1666] Alone to my nurse, who's being My old friend from youth and forth.
[1667] Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We'll call him dandy for the forth.
[1668] Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
[1669] With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
[1670] In own dreams all's being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
[1671] Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
[1672] With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
[1673] Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?
[1674] Let me look back.
[1675] At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
[1676] But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
[1677] Her face but has of wrath a track...
[1678] Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
[1679] To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol's cock.
[1680] The pistols all are now shining, The hammer's jingling at the lock,
[1681] Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock
[1682] For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
[1683] But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
[1684] And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman's hearty mock.
[1685] To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga's frock.
[1686] To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
[1687] My Eugene's standing As if by thunder has been struck,
[1688] If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
[1689] ‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
[1690] To walk?
[1691] Or, as before, he plays the crank?
[1692] Her husband's love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
[1693] Of multiplied his own crank.
[1694] And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel's crank.
[1695] At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
[1696] To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
[1697] The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
[1698] He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
[1699] Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
[1700] To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
[1701] For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
[1702] In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
[1703] She doesn't see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
[1704] In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
[1705] Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
[1706] His morbid and quite dying look,
[1707] For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
[1708] ‘Left side?.. but where? what is there?' I ‘It doesn't matter, but you look,
[1709] The hamlet, where Eugene's boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
[1710] To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
[1711] As at the reason of the parting Tatyana's grumbling at the brook,
[1712] Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
[1713] Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
[1714] Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river's crook.
[1715] And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
[1716] The evening sky's more dark.
[1717] Its dark.
[1718] Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
[1719] Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
[1720] Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
[1721] You now bless long years' work
[1722] Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shiller's work.
[1723] But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
[1724] Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
[1725] Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
[1726] Its time! - I everyday appeal.
[1727] But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
[1728] The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
[1729] The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
[1730] With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
[1731] In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
[1732] Well have the music regimental!
[1733] He came, What news, such sentimental!
[1734] Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
[1735] At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
[1736] Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;
[1737] He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
[1738] She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
[1739] Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
[1740] Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
[1741] Sometimes she's talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I'll travel
[1742] First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
[1743] Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
[1744] By night's benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
[1745] While she's by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
[1746] He doesn't go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
[1747] And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
[1748] In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
[1749] But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
[1750] Like victim under charming veil.
[1751] And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
[1752] I'd like to use the Alban's model: In Petersburg to show ball.
[1753] It's true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
[1754] It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
[1755] Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
[1756] Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journal's call:
[1757] You listen to my grievous call:
[1758] Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
[1759] Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
[1760] His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
[1761] But send your boy, and first of all' .
[1762] Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
[1763] It's in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
[1764] The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river's banks they fall.
[1765] As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
[1766] Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
[1767] Importantly repeats for doll The mother's lessons, though small.
[1768] He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
[1769] About Lensky's wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
[1770] At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
[1771] The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
[1772] Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter's bliss and tinges all:
[1773] For theatre Onegin's speeding. In it each man is free at all:
[1774] To tell you all, what he had known, I haven't any time at all.
[1775] They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
[1776] About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn't talk at all,
[1777] Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
[1778] He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn't right at all
[1779] But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It's nothing, nanny, not at all.
[1780] And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
[1781] But suddenly was changed it all:
[1782] At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all)
[1783] The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses' stall…'
[1784] The first he made - he left you all;
[1785] Healthy all...
[1786] For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
[1787] Is flying from the waxy cell.
[1788] I'm sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
[1789] To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
[1790] Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
[1791] But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
[1792] A bee to fields, of tribute well,
[1793] Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
[1794] She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
[1795] Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill
[1796] Behind the mill.
[1797] The sledge for race is now ready, In it he's flying to the mill;
[1798] Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
[1799] The waters Are still.
[1800] By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she's standing still.
[1801] You alone Among anxieties in still
[1802] It all is still.
[1803] Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest's still
[1804] Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country's still!
[1805] As I to loose my freedom feared Which's hateful to my own will.
[1806] Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn't play with doll;
[1807] Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pull…
[1808] Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
[1809] Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
[1810] ‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?'
[1811] The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
[1812] Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
[1813] On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
[1814] Opinion of the public mournful!
[1815] Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
[1816] His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
[1817] To you I'm greatful!
[1818] Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
[1819] Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,
[1820] Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
[1821] ‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
[1822] No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
[1823] You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
[1824] Its worth of fine and charming soul,
[1825] With clear soul
[1826] The doubts all confused her soul:
[1827] A bowl
[1828] That's what I am.
[1829] May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
[1830] And where everything's at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
[1831] I saw myself in cherished dream
[1832] And slowly through fields she's riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
[1833] But Tanya now like in dream
[1834] And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
[1835] In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul's quiet dream.
[1836] And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
[1837] Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
[1838] Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
[1839] Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva's stream,
[1840] But now radiant moon's ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
[1841] I — It sparkles by Hippocrene's role, It was by own play and foam
[1842] And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
[1843] With reason I remembered them.
[1844] Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
[1845] But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
[1846] And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
[1847] Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lily's stem
[1848] Princess, undone yet before him
[1849] Through tears never seeing him,
[1850] Sometimes, when he's in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
[1851] And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
[1852] And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
[1853] He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
[1854] Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
[1855] My God! what thoughts could come to him!'
[1856] Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn't come at all to him
[1857] Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
[1858] Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
[1859] And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
[1860] Alter him
[1861] You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!'
[1862] Three houses will wait for him.
[1863] And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
[1864] That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
[1865] Princess is staring at him...
[1866] - But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
[1867] From bed Onegin wasn't moving, The dream yet flies about him.
[1868] And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he's being in a whim.
[1869] What a whim...
[1870] Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
[1871] As sign of friendship's written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
[1872] What's he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
[1873] He's blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
[1874] He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
[1875] But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she's looking rather slim;
[1876] Rousseau (I'd say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
[1877] I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
[1878] The Gulnare's singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
[1879] On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
[1880] He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
[1881] A hundred times is blessed, who's faithful. Who's got his wit to be quite calm,
[1882] Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
[1883] The snow's rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
[1884] In country's place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
[1885] But will it come, my day of freedom?
[1886] The same I was in time of wisdom,
[1887] The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
[1888] They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
[1889] Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.
[1890] As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
[1891] Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom
[1892] In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
[1893] They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast's ready in the room.
[1894] The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
[1895] Reminiscence of old time, Of maiden's room!
[1896] And here is the banns room.
[1897] She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
[1898] For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
[1899] To whom my vice is not a harm?
[1900] He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
[1901] But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
[1902] Who never bores us by his charm?
[1903] And I'm afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
[1904] When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
[1905] Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm
[1906] Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.
[1907] Forgive, secluded my asylum!
[1908] For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
[1909] As quick as can
[1910] And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
[1911] And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
[1912] By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
[1913] Of bold children's secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
[1914] To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
[1915] Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
[1916] Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
[1917] The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
[1918] On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
[1919] In them I'll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
[1920] Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
[1921] His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
[1922] -it's right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
[1923] And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
[1924] Is spoiled by old duels fan, He's evil, gossip, talking man...
[1925] And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
[1926] With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
[1927] Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
[1928] To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
[1929] A simple maiden
[1930] Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
[1931] Enough... and has been done the burden:
[1932] Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
[1933] What for yet here has he been?
[1934] Where we have never been.
[1935] And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
[1936] Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
[1937] Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
[1938] Well, I saluted classicism! It's late, but preface has been seen.
[1939] My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.
[1940] Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
[1941] But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
[1942] To them He paid his all attention then.
[1943] Ah, many friends were near then!
[1944] Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!
[1945] The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
[1946] Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
[1947] By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
[1948] A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
[1949] - Not, then!
[1950] He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
[1951] Has fallen…
[1952] She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
[1953] To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
[1954] You write the odes, gentlemen,
[1955] And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…'
[1956] With Lea, that's given him too sweety; With ladies' flatness; tunes of men;
[1957] Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
[1958] Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
[1959] Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
[1960] But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
[1961] ‘Whith Olga what could happen?
[1962] Unwittingly in mirror's peeping Ashamed to recognize: he's beaten;
[1963] Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
[1964] And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
[1965] In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
[1966] -Let's go.- They were quietly driven,
[1967] The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
[1968] Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
[1969] By Olga's hand the tea's been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana's standing, She's breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window's cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
[1970] I dread to read again...
[1971] To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
[1972] The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet's cracks wee heard again.
[1973] And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she's sighing once again
[1974] In letters though he again
[1975] Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.
[1976] Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
[1977] And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
[1978] She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
[1979] Unmoving, lone he's again.
[1980] Alas! I must repeat again:
[1981] But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
[1982] For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
[1983] At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
[1984] At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
[1985] Because she's innocent and plain,
[1986] In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
[1987] Have been decayed in nature's train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
[1988] It in strain
[1989] A menu hangs for order's sake And teases appetite in vain.
[1990] Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
[1991] With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
[1992] Came in.
[1993] At brook the monument is seeing She's drawing made of leather rein,
[1994] Onegin.
[1995] And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
[1996] Tatyana's letter to Onegin.
[1997] What's my Onegin?
[1998] His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
[1999] And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
[2000] Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
[2001] But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
[2002] Presents his friend and distant kin.
[2003] The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
[2004] And then I thought: He's now in;
[2005] And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
[2006] (For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
[2007] New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
[2008] All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
[2009] He's now languished by remorse, He's being ready to beg pardon,
[2010] Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he's looking on...
[2011] Meanwhile he's dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar he's having on	{3]
[2012] What is your name? - He's looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon…
[2013] Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
[2014] But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
[2015] But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
[2016] He didn't want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
[2017] New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
[2018] And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
[2019] Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
[2020] He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
[2021] Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
[2022] Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
[2023] His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
[2024] That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
[2025] But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
[2026] Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
[2027] As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
[2028] Onegin's fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
[2029] Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
[2030] He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
[2031] I can foresee: you'll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
[2032] All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
[2033] And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
[2034] And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
[2035] Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
[2036] My Moscow... in this lunation
[2037] For you the glory and the laud, The father's land, incarceration?
[2038] To touch in splendid admiration.
[2039] Where's agitation And honourable aspiration
[2040] Great charm to any conversation.
[2041] In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
[2042] And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
[2043] Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
[2044] But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
[2045] He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
[2046] But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
[2047] To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
[2048] For thoughtful singing with attention?'
[2049] Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
[2050] In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
[2051] All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
[2052] At first they'd nothing seen In common.
[2053] Go on!
[2054] Like in van Dick's Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she's boon
[2055] Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
[2056] He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
[2057] Like thoughts of simple lady's soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
[2058] Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon
[2059] He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
[2060] Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
[2061] Byron
[2062] And what's the reason?
[2063] If by the family best vision For instant I'd be charmed with reason,-
[2064] That instant I could trunk with reason
[2065] But hero, I'm not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
[2066] And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
[2067] What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
[2068] In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
[2069] Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!'
[2070] Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,
[2071] If their district visits on?
[2072] When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
[2073] He, might be, for the world's welfare Or even for the fame was born;
[2074] Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
[2075] On table's hissing yet, forlorn...
[2076] From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
[2077] If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
[2078] The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
[2079] ‘Shall go forth or should return?..
[2080] And is it true, it can't return?
[2081] I'll take a look and then turn',
[2082] Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
[2083] And am I soon at thirties turn?
[2084] And didn't frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
[2085] By bondage Lensky's fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
[2086] He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
[2087] In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror's aiming down,
[2088] In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
[2089] Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin's eyes make tire own,
[2090] She doesn't say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
[2091] Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
[2092] For centures to make him known.
[2093] I'm unknown...
[2094] And I'm in family unknown...
[2095] All right, by hand unfair own
[2096] The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
[2097] Did try to make of that some fun: The country's freedom has its own
[2098] ‘No'.
[2099] To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
[2100] I was his friend some while ago.
[2101] Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
[2102] But it is late, it's time to go...
[2103] Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go
[2104] On steps of world the bard might go
[2105] To be with you I cannot go...
[2106] Andryushka, quicker must you go!
[2107] Annette; And on the last one you read so:
[2108] Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
[2109] To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
[2110] With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
[2111] In them you can't see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
[2112] He's happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
[2113] She runs for forest... he's about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
[2114] By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
[2115] Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
[2116] Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
[2117] A need for sleep.
[2118] Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
[2119] But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
[2120] And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
[2121] In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
[2122] At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
[2123] But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
[2124] Not a word can slip
[2125] She doesn't see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn't pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
[2126] They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
[2127] In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
[2128] I stop!
[2129] For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
[2130] All that I don't grasp.
[2131] On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
[2132] Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
[2133] To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
[2134] Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
[2135] is going, and when she's trying To turn aside... is coming up
[2136] But dangerous for the maiden's heart) Quite reddenning he's missing up.
[2137] At usual hour stirred up, In candle's light she's getting up.
[2138] By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
[2139] I've read it up:
[2140] He's rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
[2141] To other things let's make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
[2142] But other times in mind I bear!
[2143] Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
[2144] In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
[2145] Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
[2146] Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
[2147] And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
[2148] He's not been seen, none word from dear;
[2149] My poets! I'd like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear
[2150] They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
[2151] Of Russian Terpsichore's dear
[2152] He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
[2153] You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
[2154] I didn't dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
[2155] And Olga's yawning; round here She's looking for her Lensky dear.
[2156] Enough, my dear...
[2157] The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!'… -To whom, my dear?
[2158] You'll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear
[2159] That he's the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
[2160] But then your horse will try in fear
[2161] All flows in a single gear...
[2162] They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
[2163] He slept and coffee had he here, His menager's reports could hear,
[2164] -Just solemn odes you could hear!
[2165] All's filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
[2166] Goodness me, it isn't For him to hear!
[2167] When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky's sounds hear),
[2168] Shall I again your chorus hear?
[2169] D'you hear?
[2170] Tanya, near!
[2171] He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
[2172] You give a pen and paper, dear, I'll stay in bed; make table near;
[2173] ‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
[2174] To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
[2175] D'you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
[2176] In early spring of every year.
[2177] Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
[2178] ‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
[2179] When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
[2180] It's getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
[2181] His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
[2182] And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
[2183] Like Julie's lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
[2184] Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
[2185] And when a falling shining star
[2186] -What said the satirist, remember!
[2187] To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn't slumber,
[2188] The same is dog, the same's her man Which is of club the loyal number,
[2189] You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
[2190] That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
[2191] ‘I'll be defender; I'll not endure when offender
[2192] And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
[2193] Is cunning liric, who can render
[2194] His look was always quick and tender,
[2195] Such charming, tender.
[2196] A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
[2197] Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
[2198] To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
[2199] In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
[2200] What blunder! I'm a punished ranger.
[2201] She's not astonished, hasn't anger...
[2202] Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
[2203] ‘Of them my Olga is the younger.
[2204] And. told her:
[2205] For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her'.
[2206] But it's enough to speak of her:
[2207] The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
[2208] And when sometimes in front of her
[2209] The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
[2210] The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
[2211] ‘Lord! to her!..
[2212] And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
[2213] The wish of heart to whisper her.
[2214] But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear's after her!
[2215] To answer her.
[2216] And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
[2217] Tatyana hadn't any trends To play with them in any weather:
[2218] ‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!' -I'm old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin's will I'd rather…-
[2219] Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
[2220] Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
[2221] The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
[2222] But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
[2223] Some other...
[2224] Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
[2225] ‘But I'd prefer another,
[2226] ‘Tanya though!' ‘D'you know her?-
[2227] The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
[2228] It's time, its time to marry her!
[2229] And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
[2230] She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner
[2231] With blood sustained each pure hand... They'd bel.ter part in friendly manner...
[2232] All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
[2233] You now come to rooms, the inner...
[2234] And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
[2235] You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
[2236] Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
[2237] All have the supper.
[2238] The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
[2239] What shall I do, I can't foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
[2240] Well dressed, she's waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
[2241] Every country eater
[2242] Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
[2243] And you forgive, my freedom later!
[2244] But let me help with sacred water.
[2245] You are in heat.- - But I'm not ill Well... nanny, I'm in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
[2246] My God, a scene from novels dear...' -And that's my daughter...
[2247] With her he's ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
[2248] It's winter!..
[2249] ‘Well, dear me, what is the matter?
[2250] It's late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
[2251] Where is it better?
[2252] Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
[2253] All they utter
[2254] Her tender fingers didn't dare To take a needle; she could never
[2255] It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
[2256] Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
[2257] Prepare ruins once for ever...
[2258] My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.
[2259] If not... if not, let God deliver!
[2260] Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
[2261] But no answer...
[2262] She's up at once, Like shade she's pale, but no answer...
[2263] The day had gone, but no answer...
[2264] Without answer.
[2265] The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
[2266] But She whom I yet don't dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
[2267] In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
[2268] Onegin's now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
[2269] In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
[2270] And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
[2271] Hor
[2272] He opened a door."
[2273] Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
[2274] Onegin's sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
[2275] Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.
[2276] Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
[2277] My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,
[2278] In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
[2279] And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
[2280] Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal's clamour
[2281] Let's go, do thorn such a favour!
[2282] - To pour half-glass you do a favour...
[2283] In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
[2284] At sister Tanya isn't looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
[2285] Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
[2286] It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
[2287] Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl's small feet and no heads.
[2288] And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
[2289] And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
[2290] To all these letters, tears, deeds...
[2291] But where now through them speeds
[2292] But she's neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
[2293] The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
[2294] Some loss in all the song's refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
[2295] Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaid's.
[2296] And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
[2297] She's stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
[2298] A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
[2299] With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
[2300] She's getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
[2301] At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
[2302] And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
[2303] Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
[2304] Its here: take it and be ‘tackling' !) All look like silver snowy fields...
[2305] In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
[2306] By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
[2307] I was taking you in hands!
[2308] ‘And I your ears pulled by hands!'
[2309] The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
[2310] Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
[2311] On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya's shoulder he bends;
[2312] Polite; with sharp-clawed paw he's rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends
[2313] She's deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
[2314] I had happened To know many old legends,
[2315] That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
[2316] But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
[2317] All poets, meanwhile I'll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
[2318] Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
[2319] Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
[2320] Ruslan's, Lyudmila's friends!
[2321] With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
[2322] Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
[2323] Who isn't bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
[2324] And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
[2325] Among admirers obedient I've seen she-cranks of other kinds:
[2326] The heaven's bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
[2327] Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
[2328] Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
[2329] Who father's money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
[2330] Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
[2331] Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
[2332] He'll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
[2333] Let give the God his soul chances
[2334] She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
[2335] Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
[2336] Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
[2337] But that's more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
[2338] And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
[2339] At goose's neck a skull is fateful, It's whirling round for all sides;
[2340] But now, friends, from all my sides -
[2341] He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
[2342] He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
[2343] The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
[2344] It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
[2345] But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
[2346] The prince as if anew him sees:
[2347] For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
[2348] Four fatal for the life the stages...
[2349] Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
[2350] At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
[2351] From glass not stopping For a while'. He never kisses hands of ladies,
[2352] Of higher world the queer ladies!
[2353] Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
[2354] But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
[2355] And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
[2356] The snow's crackling... someone's near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
[2357] The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
[2358] At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
[2359] The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
[2360] Of yard boys family just flies.
[2361] Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
[2362] Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,
[2363] But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
[2364] At her much frightened loud cries
[2365] When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
[2366] By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
[2367] Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
[2368] It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his mother's finger shakes.
[2369] Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
[2370] In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
[2371] Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
[2372] And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one's feelings strikes.
[2373] But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
[2374] With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
[2375] With age to argue is unfitness; The custom's despot of the males.
[2376] Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,
[2377] Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
[2378] -In this I see yet no troubles…
[2379] Of daily troubles.
[2380] Is it because in higher circles
[2381] Ali that has gone like sound's fizz, And dear Tanya's youth all dwindles:
[2382] With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
[2383] He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
[2384] Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
[2385] When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
[2386] Tatyana trusted legend's fancies Of simple folk's old times.
[2387] To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
[2388] ‘Bordeaux' all the times!
[2389] His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
[2390] His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
[2391] Slipshod result of my pastimes,
[2392] I know: Parny's tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
[2393] Her husband comes.
[2394] Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!' But he becomes
[2395] But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
[2396] You take my set of florid rhymes
[2397] Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
[2398] At other kinds of lines.
[2399] Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
[2400] The foes!
[2401] Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
[2402] Why not? It's pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
[2403] For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
[2404] And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
[2405] Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
[2406] He cast a glance at ladies' tires, At circles but with looks, attires
[2407] ‘But trouble is: they are such bores'.
[2408] But can't: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades' spectres
[2409] She doesn't listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
[2410] To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
[2411] Do not reflect Diana's features, Recalling bygone novel's creatures,
[2412] I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
[2413] Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;
[2414] His pistol then Onegin raises
[2415] La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.
[2416] Indeed, by magnetism's all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
[2417] The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
[2418] Zhizhi, my soul's crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
[2419] At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
[2420] Onegin's coining with excuses.
[2421] Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
[2422] She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
[2423] With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
[2424] By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
[2425] The vice, that's gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
[2426] Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.
[2427] (In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
[2428] Some foreign words, she often writes.
[2429] Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
[2430] The first of leaflets just can show: Qu'ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
[2431] Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
[2432] Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
[2433] Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
[2434] Or aren't we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves
[2435] Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
[2436] I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
[2437] Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
[2438] Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky's village, there lives
[2439] Alas! On furrows of lives
[2440] Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,
[2441] I'd cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
[2442] Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,
[2443] Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
[2444] In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
[2445] He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant's ideas and his moves.
[2446] And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
[2447] The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
[2448] Grand treaty's ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
[2449] By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
[2450] By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
[2451] For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
[2452] Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
[2453] Of course, Onegin's not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
[2454] All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
[2455] A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
[2456] But shall I see you?' - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
[2457] My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;
[2458] He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
[2459] She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
[2460] But in gloomy cliffs
[2461] She's always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
[2462] Of known ladies feet and legs.
[2463] Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
[2464] With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
[2465] To take it up she can't, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
[2466] Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
[2467] By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel's beings,
[2468] To Moscow, they need good things.'..,
[2469] Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
[2470] All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
[2471] Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.
[2472] And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
[2473] My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine I've shooting things.
[2474] Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
[2475] Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
[2476] (If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
[2477] But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
[2478] Of agitated soul's feelings
[2479] That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
[2480] The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
[2481] She falls on snow - he is swifty: He's taking her in paws and brings,
[2482] Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings'
[2483] Onegin got Tatyana's message. It quickly touched his soul's strings:
[2484] A shepherd bast gay sandal's making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
[2485] (At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
[2486] My greetings!
[2487] That dream aroused her misgivings.
[2488] Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
[2489] Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
[2490] In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
[2491] And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
[2492] By got by Olga strange tuition She's touched, in depth of soul sighs;
[2493] Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
[2494] Decided is.
[2495] He's not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
[2496] With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
[2497] But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
[2498] He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
[2499] I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
[2500] In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
[2501] Which doesn't pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
[2502] And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
[2503] Who's there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?',
[2504] The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
[2505] Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
[2506] In all of them restriction's queer; Antiquity the old backs.
[2507] It shows traceries affective, Informs of mind's the secret backs.
[2508] The novelty with ages smacks.
[2509] But by your narrow small tracks,
[2510] Of tears tracks?..
[2511] Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest's thicks?
[2512] At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks…
[2513] The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
[2514] For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
[2515] Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river's banks.
[2516] Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
[2517] At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
[2518] The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
[2519] He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
[2520] May be, you saw at Neva's banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
[2521] The talkative my lyre's tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
[2522] She thinks:
[2523] Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,' to thinks
[2524] Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
[2525] This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
[2526] In sledge he's sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
[2527] And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
[2528] And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
[2529] His own works?
[2530] Zaretsky's bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
[2531] My muse new person just reveals.
[2532] Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
[2533] With one of feet the floor she's touching, With other slowly she wheels,
[2534] In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
[2535] And boring pictures' row, done In style of La Fontaine's sweet novels.
[2536] You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
[2537] Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
[2538] For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
[2539] Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
[2540] But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What's given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
[2541] On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
[2542] Of legislator of the halls?
[2543] At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
[2544] It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
[2545] For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
[2546] A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
[2547] The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls,
[2548] Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
[2549] In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
[2550] That time to all my childish dreams
[2551] For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
[2552] Indeed, he's blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
[2553] For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden's dreams.
[2554] Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
[2555] The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
[2556] And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
[2557] The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
[2558] In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
[2559] Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
[2560] With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
[2561] To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
[2562] The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
[2563] They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
[2564] You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
[2565] The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
[2566] Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden's.
[2567] At window alone, sad (Diana's ray lights up, her wakens)
[2568] Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
[2569] ‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
[2570] At margins of the books she's meeting Of reader's pencil slightest signs:
[2571] He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
[2572] Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
[2573] His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other's brains;
[2574] Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
[2575] We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
[2576] They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
[2577] ‘And whom?' - She's Larin's. -
[2578] All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
[2579] To have remorse I haven't forces; Like Bogdanovich's all verses I'd like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
[2580] All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
[2581] They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
[2582] In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
[2583] In young sad soul's aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
[2584] We'll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
[2585] The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
[2586] Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
[2587] Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
[2588] Of mind some cold observations,
[2589] His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
[2590] Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
[2591] He hasn't any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
[2592] The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
[2593] The folly's wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
[2594] And he inspired her at dawns!
[2595] Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
[2596] It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
[2597] Each claps.
[2598] But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
[2599] Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
[2600] Her maiden's mirror yet she keeps.
[2601] Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:
[2602] He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
[2603] Rather well The grove sleeps.
[2604] Tatyana steeps.
[2605] Of looking back she doesn't dare And hurries up, she's quickening steps,
[2606] I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid's pretty lips,
[2607] But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
[2608] Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.
[2609] Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
[2610] A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
[2611] May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
[2612] Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
[2613] ‘Well, let us go…' Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
[2614] This news Tatyana quickly hears.
[2615] And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
[2616] At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
[2617] But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana's husband just appears,
[2618] Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,
[2619] Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
[2620] The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
[2621] In crowd everybody renders:
[2622] Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
[2623] The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
[2624] Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
[2625] It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
[2626] ‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?'
[2627] Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
[2628] Brothers!
[2629] At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
[2630] At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
[2631] At any sides we'll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
[2632] My Tanya's hugged by their daughters.
[2633] In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
[2634] From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
[2635] Like North Aurora's face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
[2636] -My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
[2637] The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
[2638] The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
[2639] Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
[2640] -I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
[2641] Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
[2642] That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
[2643] Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?'
[2644] (As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
[2645] With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
[2646] For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
[2647] Says yes or no, never да-с Or нет-с'(the words, they all would pass).
[2648] While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
[2649] She doesn't glare at the rest, And doesn't claim to have success;
[2650] Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!
[2651] To meet princess.
[2652] Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don't we. confess.
[2653] Was too afraid, I must confess...
[2654] They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
[2655] At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
[2656] ‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
[2657] And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
[2658] Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it's impossible or faithless
[2659] In village, in forgotten stillness Of you I'd never know, thus I wouldn't know tortures sleepless.
[2660] What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
[2661] We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
[2662] For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
[2663] With age the life is such a badness...'
[2664] I like teenage's lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
[2665] At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment's gladness...
[2666] And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
[2667] ‘Sed alia temporal' But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
[2668] His lunch him answered with politeness.
[2669] Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
[2670] Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
[2671] He liked the grove's timid thickness,
[2672] She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
[2673] But you forgive him, games in stillness!
[2674] Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
[2675] Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
[2676] Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
[2677] As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon's foolish brightness'.
[2678] In actions husband's mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
[2679] And no brow moved she rasher; She didn't even lips her press.
[2680] Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it's a stress
[2681] And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
[2682] Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
[2683] But with Tatyana shan't we guess.
[2684] Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
[2685] A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
[2686] Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
[2687] ‘I'm not quite made to be much happy. My soul's alien for bliss;
[2688] Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them I'm not yet worthy, miss.
[2689] In duels classic, pedant cross
[2690] Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
[2691] The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
[2692] But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
[2693] She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
[2694] But doesn't lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
[2695] The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
[2696] She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
[2697] At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
[2698] Of words for songs of prairie districts...
[2699] At rocks of the Caucasian districts
[2700] Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
[2701] In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
[2702] In country tedium's prevailing Without palaces or streets,
[2703] Why! out of the country thickets...'
[2704] In deserts of the heaven's districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
[2705] By sorcery of story's secrets!
[2706] To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
[2707] For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
[2708] The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
[2709] The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
[2710] The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
[2711] But where are you? Come! My rights
[2712] Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
[2713] My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
[2714] By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
[2715] Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
[2716] With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
[2717] At window she now sits.
[2718] Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
[2719] He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
[2720] The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
[2721] Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
[2722] I'm greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
[2723] Apostate of wild enjoyments,
[2724] By him were left at your employments.
[2725] Whom don't bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
[2726] Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
[2727] You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
[2728] And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
[2729] And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
[2730] Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies' hearts.
[2731] Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
[2732] What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
[2733] But landlords of the country's peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
[2734] She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
[2735] Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
[2736] To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
[2737] And he invents by whim's requests Caricatures of the guests.
[2738] But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
[2739] And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
[2740] Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
[2741] Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
[2742] Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
[2743] Yet does it whirl the world and us:
[2744] Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
[2745] -I'm glad. - ‘but when?' -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
[2746] But even such a friendship, readers, We haven't now; each of us
[2747] We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
[2748] With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
[2749] The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she's liking us,
[2750] What for you visited all us?
[2751] Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
[2752] With dear muse of mine capricious Let's hear forest's noise delicious
[2753] The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
[2754] At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
[2755] This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it's always zealous,
[2756] Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous
[2757] Alone you, to speak my mind, I'd take as friend of days my grievous,
[2758] And Tatyana's nervous
[2759] O , rus!
[2760] To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
[2761] And let them God long live for us!
[2762] Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
[2763] The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
[2764] By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
[2765] We them remind about us...
[2766] His verse is sluggish and obscure (It's called romanticism by us;
[2767] The seasons country views
[2768] Meanwhile Onegin's stay at Larin's Was estimated like a news,
[2769] In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
[2770] To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
[2771] Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
[2772] Some cold wind just blows.
[2773] A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
[2774] 'But may be she's in love?' ‘Who knows?
[2775] That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
[2776] In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
[2777] In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
[2778] By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
[2779] From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
[2780] You'll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
[2781] Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
[2782] Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
[2783] To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
[2784] ‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
[2785] All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
[2786] Will take the twilight of my days.
[2787] For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
[2788] At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I've my happy days...'
[2789] Who's helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
[2790] Without fail you'll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch's rays;
[2791] Who's that, which never us betrays?
[2792] The woman says:
[2793] And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
[2794] In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I'll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
[2795] Can't wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
[2796] The withering of own days, Which can't revive by any ways?
[2797] It's dark in valleys.
[2798] And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
[2799] Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)
[2800] A dwarf with tail; and there's that Who's half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
[2801] He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums's beat.
[2802] Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
[2803] They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
[2804] What?
[2805] She hurries up to have a chat.
[2806] In dark my Tanya's quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
[2807] But why? I don't grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
[2808] Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
[2809] Of dear friends a pretty chat.
[2810] Then he for her a chair's finding, They speak about this and that,
[2811] (It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
[2812] For all of that
[2813] With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
[2814] As they are mean and simple features, You won't see fine art in that.
[2815] For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
[2816] (Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
[2817] And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
[2818] And what.
[2819] And what?
[2820] And what? -
[2821] And what?
[2822] And what?
[2823] ‘But do you love, indeed, the other?' -And what? -
[2824] She's taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
[2825] But never wanted to correct; To censorship I'll pay my debt;
[2826] But may be those kinds of pictures By now can't you all attract,
[2827] You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
[2828] His letter's here, quite exact.
[2829] Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
[2830] With yawn I'll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
[2831] He differed people in effect, And other's passions could respect.
[2832] And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
[2833] He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
[2834] Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
[2835] The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
[2836] For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
[2837] Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
[2838] But I can hardly drag my feet,
[2839] And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
[2840] For garden now we shall fleet In which she's got with him to meet.
[2841] With kin to meet
[2842] Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
[2843] But many days away could get
[2844] Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
[2845] Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
[2846] Of own life he could forget!
[2847] In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
[2848] ‘I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
[2849] Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
[2850] In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
[2851] And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
[2852] Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
[2853] But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
[2854] Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
[2855] The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
[2856] Of stylish words some ready set?
[2857] But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
[2858] Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
[2859] ‘You now meet...' - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
[2860] Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
[2861] - Yes and no yet.
[2862] But summer's flying quicker yet.
[2863] B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
[2864] Is he a parody not yet?
[2865] My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
[2866] Because ire, truthfulness she's swift? Because from heavens got as gift
[2867] Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
[2868] Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
[2869] By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
[2870] I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
[2871] Shall see emotional flight?
[2872] Should I begin my freedom flight.
[2873] She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter's crackling making light.
[2874] All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
[2875] Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
[2876] Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forge's light
[2877] The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven's bodies light
[2878] And fair sex like down's slight...
[2879] All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
[2880] Opinions of the worldly might...
[2881] In languish of the loving bounds He's spending now day and night.
[2882] And often at Taurida's beaches She brought me in the have of night
[2883] By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
[2884] And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
[2885] Of ballet's noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
[2886] And often in the summer's sphere, When clear is the sky at night
[2887] For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
[2888] They don't listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
[2889] I don't grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
[2890] Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
[2891] With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
[2892] It's right.
[2893] The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn't right.
[2894] To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
[2895] It's time to leave for life the tight
[2896] One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
[2897] As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who's lost in thought,
[2898] Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
[2899] The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
[2900] For her he's looking on... for nought...
[2901] They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea's been brought.
[2902] This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
[2903] But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
[2904] Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.
[2905] ‘It's seven soon, it's time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to wait'.
[2906] With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
[2907] 'My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.
[2908] He stepped away... he turned a bit..'-
[2909] Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
[2910] ‘My habit,..
[2911] And proud language's now lit For prose postal a bit.
[2912] The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
[2913] With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
[2914] ‘My dreams and years won't rather Return to make me new a bit,
[2915] Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
[2916] Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
[2917] Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,
[2918] The letter's ready, has been fit...
[2919] Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
[2920] I was embittered, he… unfit.
[2921] Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
[2922] But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You'll never leave me such unfit.
[2923] With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
[2924] In front of him gay fancy's giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
[2925] For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
[2926] It's better place for passing letters fit.
[2927] Istómina's in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
[2928] My student's cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,
[2929] Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!
[2930] Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
[2931] I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
[2932] Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
[2933] Onegin's life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
[2934] Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
[2935] With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
[2936] Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
[2937] -But what is it -
[2938] A yard boy's running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
[2939] Together for a time they sit.
[2940] Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
[2941] On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
[2942] To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
[2943] Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
[2944] With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
[2945] Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
[2946] His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
[2947] His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
[2948] And by degrees to sleep he's reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
[2949] In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
[2950] Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
[2951] Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
[2952] What happened, what a strange a dreamt
[2953] Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can't...
[2954] But yet she can't.
[2955] And now jealouser's triumphant!
[2956] Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn't want:
[2957] As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn't want
[2958] And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don't want;
[2959] Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don't want.
[2960] What more you want?
[2961] To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
[2962] Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
[2963] As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
[2964] By dreadful exclamation Onegin's shuddered; slain, impatient
[2965] Are silent.
[2966] To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
[2967] What will he choose for his engagement?
[2968] That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
[2969] Some balls, one children's entertainment...
[2970] And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
[2971] Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in love's adjustment
[2972] Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
[2973] At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
[2974] Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
[2975] The inns are absent.
[2976] Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
[2977] Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn't join the guild existent
[2978] Haphazard wander to prevent.
[2979] And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
[2980] The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin's soon forever went:
[2981] They joked, not without sin At Tanya's suitor made a hint.
[2982] About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation's lint, -
[2983] But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
[2984] And stands at stint
[2985] Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana's heart was burnt!
[2986] Not...
[2987] Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
[2988] The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
[2989] Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
[2990] From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
[2991] The mistress cries, ‘At last you've got!'
[2992] We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
[2993] But uncoordinated volumes From devil's library all got,
[2994] Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
[2995] The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
[2996] Is it high time as I forgot
[2997] ‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.'.
[2998] Lornette his captious he has got,
[2999] Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
[3000] He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
[3001] The youthful years would be fading, The soul's heat would not be hot
[3002] Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
[3003] It might he other: he'd he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
[3004] And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
[3005] Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
[3006] Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
[3007] But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover's lot:
[3008] And… he could not.
[3009] ‘Do not.'
[3010] Is it not
[3011] At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
[3012] They didn't use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
[3013] She's nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn't give a hoot..
[3014] But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
[3015] Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
[3016] Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
[3017] Became alredy quite inapt.
[3018] It's nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
[3019] And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
[3020] Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
[3021] Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
[3022] Of grievous notes of the heart.
[3023] About other's restless passions, And other's love will touch the heart, -
[3024] Indeed, you won't With all your pure flaming heart
[3025] For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
[3026] By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
[3027] Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
[3028] He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama's heart.
[3029] Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
[3030] It's all decided (it's my version) By heavens board: I'm yours at heart.
[3031] In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
[3032] But to no person In all the world I'd give my heart,
[3033] For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
[3034] Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
[3035] For nowhere am I smart...
[3036] To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
[3037] It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
[3038] With which to start?
[3039] And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
[3040] It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
[3041] It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
[3042] Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
[3043] But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..'
[3044] In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
[3045] He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
[3046] Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
[3047] You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
[3048] May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
[3049] But at least
[3050] I haven't force... is tired breast…
[3051] In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
[3052] Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
[3053] To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
[3054] Of what a languor's full her breast?
[3055] For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
[3056] ‘It's mine!' the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
[3057] And how long?' ‘Two will he fast...'
[3058] And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
[3059] Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
[3060] And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
[3061] Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
[3062] He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
[3063] Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
[3064] And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!'
[3065] The spring of honour, idol last!
[3066] That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
[3067] He's very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
[3068] At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
[3069] To scratch unfaithful icy path As he's afraid to fall at last.
[3070] She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
[3071] To inner porch he goes fast, He's laying down her at last.
[3072] A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
[3073] With own wife that's very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
[3074] And stilly does she say at last:
[3075] Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
[3076] Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
[3077] I liked his features in the past:
[3078] His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
[3079] But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won't be the best.
[3080] Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
[3081] ‘My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
[3082] Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
[3083] For love she's dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother's nest,
[3084] New way I'm starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
[3085] Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
[3086] With heavenly her pride she's touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
[3087] Let's come together... take a rest...
[3088] Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
[3089] She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
[3090] The ‘else's trends', for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
[3091] He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
[3092] On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let's have dinner before rest!
[3093] In talks all's plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
[3094] Monsieur l'Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,
[3095] What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
[3096] In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
[3097] He made me love him with insistence And couldn't find some better test.
[3098] She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
[3099] The beds are made. And any guest
[3100] But hist!
[3101] In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
[3102] Not Eugene he's at most?
[3103] Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isn't frozen by frost.
[3104] He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
[3105] The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
[3106] With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
[3107] ‘I'm neighbour just'.
[3108] It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
[3109] ‘Enough, get up, I now must
[3110] The fire's dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal's crust;
[3111] Was shaking. Due to Zues he's being The heir of all relatives in trust.
[3112] Deserted room alone filling You read; it's Pradt, it's Walter Scott.
[3113] When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
[3114] In book's short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
[3115] -But what about?
[3116] Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
[3117] The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
[3118] Again promiscuosly he's reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
[3119] She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
[3120] But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
[3121] In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
[3122] If I were poet like you.
[3123] With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka's language ‘I love you' .
[3124] You, Moscow, I thought of you!
[3125] Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I'd like with you
[3126] I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I'd run from you;
[3127] Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
[3128] Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,
[3129] To you I'll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
[3130] But what I'd want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
[3131] The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
[3132] To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
[3133] Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
[3134] At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
[3135] In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
[3136] Believe, I'd never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
[3137] ‘For single winter it will do, At least I'll credit money you'…
[3138] It's signed by t.a.v.
[3139] Dmitriyev.
[3140] All's now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy Pustyakóv
[3141] With own heavy hall, his dear; Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
[3142] From two to thirty years on; The district dandy Petushkóv,
[3143] Griboyedov
[3144] (Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired Flyánov,
[3145] I love him, he's my kin in-law.
[3146] In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
[3147] Lensky saw
[3148] Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,
[3149] Or Sbogar, mythical a few.
[3150] (A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
[3151] But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
[3152] Of life her features have but few.
[3153] And me you have in view...
[3154] What for would ever view
[3155] Among the friends the moon's more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
[3156] Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
[3157] The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
[3158] I've heard some voice of new desire, I've got new sorrow anew;
[3159] And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
[3160] Effects, but stepped away anew; He's blessed much more, who never knew
[3161] And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
[3162] And with a bow
[3163] He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
[3164] How would you not love Moscow?
[3165] To-morrow we'll Tanya show...
[3166] For changes fated anyhow...
[3167] In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
[3168] She's been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
[3169] What kind's he now anyhow?
[3170] At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
[3171] Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
[3172] A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
[3173] Of lively lucid verse's glow,
[3174] ‘What, you are married! didn't know!
[3175] D'you know?...
[3176] That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
[3177] For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
[3178] Is he the same or quiet now?
[3179] But now...
[3180] I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
[3181] This kind of book yet doesn't show The writer's fancies in a row,
[3182] Two pistols in a row,
[3183] She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,
[3184] Tatyana's interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:
[3185] We haven't any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
[3186] And in a day
[3187] But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
[3188] And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
[3189] But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
[3190] The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
[3191] Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
[3192] You'd better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
[3193] On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
[3194] Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
[3195] The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
[3196] He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
[3197] Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
[3198] Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
[3199] When he's at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
[3200] All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
[3201] From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
[3202] I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
[3203] Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
[3204] ‘Me?' - Yes, Tatyana's name-day happy Will be on Saturday...
[3205] And gradually rises day.
[3206] Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
[3207] To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
[3208] To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
[3209] In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
[3210] She's playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
[3211] Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
[3212] You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
[3213] Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
[3214] On river's batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
[3215] And drifting of the country's pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
[3216] The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
[3217] She's dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
[3218] All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
[3219] The further I'm from youth my gay,
[3220] By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
[3221] Zaretsky cautiously could lay
[3222] By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
[3223] He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
[3224] ‘I fell in love', again she whispers In nurse's ear in dismay.
[3225] The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
[3226] And. so cunny, she is gay. Already's able to betray!
[3227] With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
[3228] At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
[3229] What do you want to ask, you say!
[3230] Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
[3231] Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
[3232] But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
[3233] Her tired look and slipped away...
[3234] At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
[3235] Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
[3236] Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
[3237] And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
[3238] I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
[3239] The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
[3240] His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
[3241] And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
[3242] Her head to shoulder's inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
[3243] She's trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
[3244] And she, as if she's burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
[3245] Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
[3246] Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
[3247] Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.
[3248] ‘What's happened?'- `Nothing'… - Gets away.
[3249] To call some people gets away.
[3250] Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
[3251] ‘I fell in love... you'd get away
[3252] When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
[3253] Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
[3254] She went away.
[3255] From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
[3256] And all grandparents exclaim: 'But how years fly away!'
[3257] His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
[3258] At him she stares all the way:
[3259] With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
[3260] Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
[3261] Then we'll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
[3262] Moldavia, that's far away From Italy, was end of way.
[3263] In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
[3264] From mountains descends this way
[3265] ‘What way?

[3285] The novel's pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
[3286] To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
[3287] On jade postillion's sitting ragged, Emaciated, beard's shaggy.
[3288] More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,
[3289] And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
[3290] And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.

[3325] Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
[3326] Exactly...
